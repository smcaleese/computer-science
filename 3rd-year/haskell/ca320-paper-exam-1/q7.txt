This machine is a non-deterministic finite automaton because there is a rule where the same from state
and symbol leads to two different after states.
When the state is q0 and the current instruction is a, the next state could
be q0 or q1 making the machine non-deterministic.

The regular expression that this machine accepts is:
(b|a)*abb
