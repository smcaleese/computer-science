3.1)

The PDA is deterministic because each state of the PDA only matches one rule. Since each state of the PDA has only
one possible future state, the PDA never branches making it deterministic.

3.2)

The language is accepted by the PDA above.

For example, this is how the PDA would run given the input string "abbba"

Current String Symbol, State, Stack
a, q0, empty
b, q1, A
b, q1, B
b, q1, B
a, q1, B
end, q2, empty
