No. This question is answered by the Halting Problem.

Suppose that there is a turing machine H which either halts or doesn't halt.
The halting problem is the question of whether another turing machine can know whether
this turing machine will go on forever or not.

A turing machine D has this purpose and is the opposite of H. If H halts,
D does not halt and therefore produces no answer. If H does not halt, D halts.
However, since H does not halt, D will never be able to halt either.
This contradiction shows that it is impossible to build a Turing machine that can
determine whether another turing machine halts or not.

Either either case, the machine D does not halt and therefore is never capable of
answering the question of whether H halts or not.
